# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

- connect
- connect-with-store

实现redux-connect函数，从依赖于业务逻辑到抽出store对象，重点理解利用函数进行组合。

如果能够实现connect函数，那么理解与使用react-redux则变得非常简单。
